        <h1>My Hero - Batman (Bruce Wayne)</h1>
        <p>Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is a vigilante from Gotham City. Unlike many superheroes, Batman has no superhuman abilities. Instead, he relies on his exceptional intelligence, martial arts skills, and vast resources to fight crime. His alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is a wealthy businessman, and he uses his wealth to fund his crime-fighting gadgets and vehicles, such as the iconic Batmobile. His strong moral code prevents him from killing his enemies, and he serves as a symbol of justice and resilience in the face of adversity.</p>
