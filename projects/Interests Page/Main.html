        <h1>My Interest:</h1>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Playing the guitar is probably one of the things that I first love doing, especially when my dad was taeching me how to play. It was a memory that I will always cherish that I got to play with Him. I’m strumming my favorite songs or creating new melodies, the guitar allows me to connect with my emotions and share them.I find joy in the creative process and love exploring different genres and styles.</p>
        <h2>Playing Sports</h2>
        <p>Playing Sports, mainly basketball is one the things I know I am good at. I really enjoy how I can make a lot of friends just from playing the game. I really like the aspect of teamwork that really helps people grow and understand each other. Being on the court, working with my teammates, and scoring points all make it a great way to spend my time.</p>
        <h2>Reading a Book</h2>
        <p>I also have a strong passion for reading books. Getting lost in a good book allows me to escape into different worlds and perspectives, whether it’s a thrilling adventure, an insightful non-fiction piece, or a deep character-driven story. Reading helps me relax while expanding my knowledge and imagination. Each new book is an opportunity to learn something new or see the world from a different point of view, and I love the balance it brings to my downtime activities.</p>
