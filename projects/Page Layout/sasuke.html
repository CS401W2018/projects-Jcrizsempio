                Sasuke Uchiha is one of the last surviving members of the Uchiha Clan. His entire clan was wiped out by his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, which led Sasuke to swear revenge against him. Throughout his journey, Sasuke has been driven by his quest for power and vengeance, often walking a dark path to achieve his goals.

                Despite the darkness that surrounds him, Sasuke's skills as a ninja are unparalleled. He is a master of the Sharingan and later awakens the Mangeky≈ç Sharingan and Rinnegan. His complex relationship with Naruto, ranging from rivalry to friendship, has been a central theme in the series, influencing both of their destinies.
