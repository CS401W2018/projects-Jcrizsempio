        <p>James Harden has always been an inspiration to me because of the way he plays the game with such skill and confidence. His step-back three is iconic, but its his work ethic and creativity on the court that really stand out to me. I admire how he can take control of a game, not just as a scorer but as a playmaker too. Hardenâ€™s ability to stay calm under pressure and lead by example is something I really look up to.</p>
