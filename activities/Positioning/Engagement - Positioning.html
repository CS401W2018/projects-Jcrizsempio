    <h2>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h2>
        <p>Block tags are elements that start on a new line and take up the full width of their container. Examples include div, h1, and p. Inline tags, on the other hand, stay on the same line and only take up as much space as they need. Examples of inline tags are span, a, and strong.</p>
    <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p>Normal flow in HTML is how elements are arranged on a web page by default. Block-level elements, like divs and paragraphs, stack on top of each other, starting a new line for each one. Inline elements, like spans and links, sit next to each other on the same line. This flow keeps the layout organized based on the order of the elements in the HTML code. When you add or remove elements, the rest adjust automatically.</p>
    <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p>The `float` property in CSS moves elements to the left or right, allowing text and other content to wrap around them. For example, you might float an image to have text flow beside it. Clearing the float is necessary to prevent layout problems. When you float an element, the container might not recognize it, causing it to collapse. By clearing the float, you make sure the container includes the floated elements and stays properly sized.</p>
    <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p>In CSS, absolute, fixed, and relative control how elements are positioned on a page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolute positions an element based on its closest positioned ancestor or the page itself if none is found.</li>
            <li>Fixed keeps an element in the same spot on the screen, even when you scroll.</li>
            <li>Relative adjusts an element's position based on where it normally would be in the flow of the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These methods help you place elements exactly where you want them.</p>
    <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p>To make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices, start with a design that adjusts to different screen sizes. Keep the layout simple and limit the number of buttons to avoid clutter. Make buttons large enough to tap easily, with clear labels so users know what they do. Add visual feedback, like color changes, to show when a button is pressed. Using rounded corners and bright colors can help the buttons stand out and be more inviting.</p>
