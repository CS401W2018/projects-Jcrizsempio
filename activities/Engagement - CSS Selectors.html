        <h2>List out the different ways to select an item.</h2>
        <p>In CSS, you can select items using different types of selectors. For example, you can select by tag name (like p for paragraphs), by class (like .my-class), or by ID (like #my-id). You can also target items based on their attributes, their position in the document, or their state (like when you hover over a link), allowing you to style your webpage precisely.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between an ID and a Class?</h2>
        <p>An ID is unique within a webpage and can only be used once, while a class can be applied to multiple elements. IDs have higher specificity, meaning their styles will override those of classes if both are used on the same element. Generally, IDs are for unique elements, while classes are for grouping similar elements together.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a SPAN tag and a DIV tag?</h2>
        <p>The span tag is an inline element that doesnâ€™t start on a new line and is used for styling small portions of text within a block. In contrast, the div tag is a block-level element that starts on a new line and takes up the full width, making it ideal for grouping larger sections of content. These differences determine how each tag affects layout and formatting in a webpage.</p>
        <h2>What is the difference between a DIV tag and HEADER, MAIN, FOOTER?</h2>
        <p>The div tag is a generic block-level container used for grouping and styling content without conveying any specific meaning. In contrast, the header, main, and footer tags are semantic elements that provide meaning to the structure of a webpage:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The header tag is used for introductory content or navigational links, usually at the top of a page.</li>
            <li>The main tag represents the primary content of the document, distinguishing it from other areas like headers and footers.</li>
            <li>The footer tag is used for footer content, often containing information about the author, copyright, or related links.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What are different ways to select a color?</h2>
        <p>
            In CSS, you can choose colors in different ways, such as using color names like "red," hex codes like #FF5733, or RGB values like rgb(255, 87, 51). You can also use RGBA for colors with transparency (like rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5)), as well as HSL (like hsl(12, 100%, 60%)) and HSLA for both color and transparency. These options let you pick colors easily for your designs.</p>
