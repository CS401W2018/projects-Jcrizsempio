        Structural Tags (HEADER, NAV, MAIN, FOOTER)</h2>
    <br>
    <h2>What goes in the header?</h2>
    <p>This section of an HTML document includes essential metadata, such as the page title, character set, and viewport settings for responsive design.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h2>
    <p>The nav element is used to define navigation links within a website, typically containing links to the main sections or pages. Yes, the nav can be placed within the header, which is common for primary navigation menus, but it doesnâ€™t have to be; it can exist anywhere in the document structure.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What goes in Main?</h2>
    <p>The "main" element contains the primary content of a webpage, such as articles, sections, and forms directly related to the page's main topic. It can also include relevant images or media that enhance this content. This structure helps organize information clearly, making it easily accessible for users and search engines.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What goes in the Footer?</h2>
    <p>The "footer" element typically contains information such as copyright details, navigation links to important pages (like privacy policy and terms of service), and contact information. It may also include links to social media profiles and credits for contributors.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>HTML Validation</h2>
    <p>HTML validation checks your code against W3C standards to ensure it is well-formed and free of errors, improving browser compatibility</p>
