    <h2>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h2>
    <p>CSS Grid</p>
        <blockquote>
            CSS Grid is a layout system that allows you to create complex, two-dimensional grid structures with rows and columns. You define the grid with grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns, and then place items into specific grid areas. It provides precise control over both horizontal and vertical placement, making it ideal for intricate layouts like entire web page structures or dashboards. With CSS Grid, you can also control spacing, alignment, and element sizing in a more structured way compared to Flexbox CSS.

    <p>CSS Flex</p>
        <blockquote>
            CSS Flexbox is a layout tool that helps arrange items in a row or a column. It makes it easy to align and space out items, even when the container changes size. Flexbox automatically adjusts the size of items to fit the space, and you can easily center or align them. It's great for simpler layouts, like navigation bars or buttons, where you only need to arrange things in a straight line.
