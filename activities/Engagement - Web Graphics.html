    <h1>Image Formats and Resizing</h1>

    <h2>1. What kind of photos are good to encode using JPEG?</h2>
    <p>JPEG is ideal for photographs with smooth gradients and a wide range of colors, such as landscape, portrait, and nature photos. It is a lossy format that efficiently compresses images, making it great for web use where file size matters.</p>

    <h2>2. What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</h2>
    <p>GIF is best for images with limited colors, such as simple graphics, logos, and animations. It supports a maximum of 256 colors and is often used for images with flat areas of color or those requiring transparency.</p>

    <h2>3. What is unique about the PNG format?</h2>
    <p>PNG (Portable Network Graphics) supports lossless compression, meaning it retains all image data without quality loss. It also supports transparency and a wider color palette than GIF, making it suitable for high-quality images and graphics.</p>

    <h2>4. How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</h2>
    <p>To resize a photo, use photo editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or online tools. Open the image, choose the resize option, and input the desired dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio to avoid distortion.</p>

    <h2>5. Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS?</h2>
    <p>Resizing images using photo editing software ensures better quality, as it reduces the file size and removes unnecessary pixels, improving load times. CSS resizing only affects display size and does not reduce file size, which can lead to slower page load times and wasted bandwidth.</p>
