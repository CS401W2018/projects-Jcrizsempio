    <h2>What you learned about Flex and CSS.</h2>
        <p>I learn that Flex is a way to arrange things on a webpage easily. When you use Flexbox, you can line up items in a row or a column and adjust their space around them. It helps make sure everything looks good on different screen sizes, like on phones or computers. Overall, Flexbox makes building websites simpler and more flexible</p>
    <h2>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</h2>
        <p>Having an accessible website means making sure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use it easily. This helps people who may have trouble seeing, hearing, or using a mouse to access information and services online. Itâ€™s important because it makes the internet a friendlier place for everyone and can even help more people find and enjoy your site. Making a website accessible is all about including everyone!</p>
