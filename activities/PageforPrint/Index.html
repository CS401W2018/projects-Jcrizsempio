    <h2>Why is the viewport meta tag important?</h2>
        <p>The viewport meta tag is important because it helps websites look good on different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices. It allows the page to resize and fit properly, preventing horizontal scrolling. By controlling how users zoom in and out, it makes navigation easier and improves the overall experience. Using this tag also helps with search engine rankings, as it shows that your site is mobile friendly.</p>
    <h2>How can you adjust the CSS for printing?</h2>
        <p>To adjust CSS for printing, you can use special rules that only apply when someone prints the page. For example, you can hide elements that aren't needed in print or change the font size to make it easier to read. You can also create a separate stylesheet just for print styles. This way, your website will look good and be easy to read when printed.</p>
    <h2>When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</h2>
        <p>You might want to adjust CSS for printing to hide things like menus and ads that aren’t needed on paper. It’s also important to change font sizes, colors, and layouts to make the printed page clear and easy to read, ensuring everything fits well and looks good. Using @media print in CSS lets you apply these changes specifically for print..</p>
