        <h2>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h2>
        <p>Block tags are like big building blocks that always start on a new line and take up the whole width of the page, like a paragraph or a section. Inline tags are smaller pieces that fit next to each other on the same line, like words in a sentence. You use block tags to create sections of content and inline tags to highlight or style parts of that content without breaking the flow. So, block tags help organize your layout, while inline tags help with details.</p>
        <h2>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
        <p>Margin is the space outside an element that keeps it away from other elements, like a cushion. Border is the line that wraps around the element, which can be styled in different ways, like a frame for a picture. Padding is the space inside the element that gives the content some breathing room, like a pillow around a toy. So, margin is outside, border is the frame, and padding is inside!</p>
        <h2>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
        <p>In CSS, you can use different units to measure things like size and spacing. Some common ones are pixels (px), which are like tiny dots on the screen, and percentages (%), which show how much space something takes compared to its container. There are also em and rem units, which are based on the size of text, helping to keep things flexible. Lastly, viewport units like vw and vh relate to the size of the screen, so they adjust as the window changes.</p>
        <h2>When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
        <p>You would use a figure tag when you want to show a picture, chart, or any media along with a caption that explains it. It helps to group the image and its description together so they’re clearly connected. For example, if you have a photo and a little note about it, you’d put them inside a figure tag. This makes your webpage easier to understand and looks nice</p>
