    <h1>Engagement - Background Images</h1>
    <h2>1. When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</h2>
    <p>Use a background image when you want to make your website look nice without it being the main focus, like adding fun patterns or colors. It helps the image fit well on different screens. Use the img tag for pictures that tell a story or give important information, like photos of animals or toys, because it helps people find them on search engines and makes them easier to understand. The img tag is also better for pictures you can click on. So, background images are for decoration, while img tags are for important pictures.</p>
