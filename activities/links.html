        <h2>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p>An absolute link gives the full web address, including the website and path, while a relative link shows a path based on the current page. Relative links are handy because they work even if you move your site to a new address or change its structure. They also make it easier to test your site during development.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with a Forward Slash: If you want to link to a file at the root of your website, start the link with a forward slash</li>
            <li>Use Two Dots for Parent Directories: To link to a file in a parent directory, use two dots followed by a forward slash </li>
            <li>Keep Paths Consistent: Make sure to maintain a consistent folder structure, so your relative links work correctly as you navigate between pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h2>
        <p>No, links donâ€™t have to be inside a nav tag. The nav tag is just for organizing navigation links, making it easier for browsers and assistive tools to understand. You can put links anywhere in your HTML, like in paragraphs or other sections.</p>
